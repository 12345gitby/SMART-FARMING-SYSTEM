# SMART FARMING SYSTEM

The **SMART FARMING SYSTEM** is an advanced agricultural solution that leverages modern technologies like sensors, edge devices, AI, and cloud computing to optimize farming practices. This system is designed to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions, improving crop yields, conserving resources, and enhancing overall productivity.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Soil Analysis**  
  - Utilizes NPK sensors, pH sensors, and temperature sensors to monitor soil conditions.  

- **Crop Recommendation System**  
  - AI-powered predictions suggest the best crops for the soil based on current conditions.  

- **Efficient Irrigation Management**  
  - Smart algorithms schedule irrigation to optimize water usage and maintain ideal soil moisture.  

- **Fertilizer Optimization**  
  - Recommends suitable fertilizers from a curated dataset of 100 options to enrich soil fertility.  

- **Elder-Friendly Interface**  
  - Simplified UI with intuitive navigation for older users.  

- **Chatbot Integration**  
  - Provides quick answers to queries related to farming and system usage.  

- **Localization Support**  
  - Multi-language support ensures accessibility for users across different regions.
